First CNN,
    - use two 128 neurons convolutional layers at the middle with regulation l2 (for reduce overfitting)
    - the results graphs are given for only 35 epochs, (since this take more time to calculated 100 epochs)

second CNN,
    - does not use the middle 128 neurons convolutional layers and dence layer size is reduced to 128 neurons
    - the results graphs are given for only 20 epochs, (since this take more time to calculated 100 epochs)

Third CNN,
    - does not use the middle 128 neurons convolutional layers and dence layer size is  to 512 neurons
    - the results graphs are given for only 20 epochs, (since this take more time to calculated 100 epochs)

sometimes, the google colaboratory was used to get results since is uses faster GPU acceleration
